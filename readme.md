# Knowledge Cubes

## Welcome!

The purpose of this repository is to revisit the way how scientific industry works. The general idea is that science should be widely open and accessible to anyone who is interested, giving the ability to contribute in an easy way.

## Concept

![concept](./concept.jpeg)

This project reimagines the scientific industry by making science open and accessible to all. The core idea involves visualizing humanity's scientific knowledge as a dynamic graph of "Knowledge Cubes." Each cube, representing an aspect of information, falls into categories like idea, experiment, conclusion, or compilation. Researchers interact with these cubes by creating, modifying, reviewing and collaborating. The project aims for true openness, community collaboration, spontaneous contributions, and shared ideas, fostering a more satisfying and focused research environment for a better world.

## Assumptions of the New Approach

The assumptions outlined propose a conceptual framework for an advanced knowledge management system tailored for the research community. The key features and principles of this system include:

1. **Compatibility and Extension:** The system should seamlessly integrate with existing research processes while offering additional functionalities. For example, traditional publications can coexist with linked knowledge cubes.

2. **Researcher-Centric Approach:** Researchers should have complete control and ownership of their knowledge cubes. The research process should be transparent, reproducible, and place the researcher at the center of the entire system.

3. **Copyright Support:** The system should respect copyright laws, allowing researchers to choose licenses for their knowledge cubes, protecting intellectual property, and offering flexibility in terms of visibility and accessibility.

4. **Ownership and Privacy:** Researchers should be able to own and control parts of the space, deciding who can access or contribute to it. The system should support the creation of private and public spaces, enabling collaboration or exclusivity as desired.

5. **Graph-Based Navigation:** The system should maintain a cohesive graph of interconnected knowledge cubes, allowing researchers to easily navigate and understand dependencies between their own work and that of others.

6. **Public Sharing:** Researchers should have the option to make their knowledge cubes public, facilitating collaboration and feedback within the wider scientific community.

7. **Decentralization:** Each research unit should have complete ownership of its knowledge cubes, allowing for local or remote storage and synchronization with other research units.

8. **Authorization and Collaboration:** Authorized researchers should be able to browse, review, comment, modify, and reference knowledge cubes. The system should encourage collaboration and contribution to the advancement of science.

9. **Versioning and Evolution:** The system should support versioning for knowledge cubes, acknowledging the evolving nature of research. Researchers should be able to track, compare, revert, or merge changes as needed.

10. **Information Propagation:** Changes to knowledge cubes should be propagated across the system, enabling researchers to stay informed about updates relevant to their work and adjust accordingly.

11. **Real-Time Communication:** The system should facilitate direct and real-time communication among researchers, promoting efficient exchange of ideas and opinions to shorten communication paths.
